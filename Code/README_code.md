# README_code

All codes base on ***MATLAB*** and can be run individually. Each **.m** file are named by its meaning (Early version maynot). 

Here I've sorted the code by year and month, **24** means 2024, **2312** means December 2023, all these codes are for base flow calculation, perturbation analysis and roll-wave calculations.

Strongly recommend you to run codes in 2024 years which are better than those in 2023 package , some codes are reconstructed and can refer to contents in **PPT_discussion** dir.
